     I don’t think I’ve ever been good at loving halfway.
When I care, I care deeply, and with you, that feeling feels safe.
You let me be exactly who I am without asking me to shrink or change,
and still somehow make me want to grow.
    </p>

    <p class="letter">
     You are my laughter on good days and my calm on overwhelming ones.
You ground me without dulling me, and you excite me without making me feel lost.
With you, love feels steady but never boring, comforting but never heavy.
    </p>

    <p class="letter">
    I love the way you think.
I love the way you show up.
I love the way being with you feels like home, even when everything else feels uncertain.
    </p>

     <p class="letter">
 If loving you means choosing you every day,
then I hope you know I make that choice gladly.
Not just today.
Not just on Valentine’s Day.
But in all the small moments that matter the most.
    </p>

<p class="letter end">
  You feel like something I don’t want to overthink.  
  I just want to keep choosing you.
</p>



    <p class="letter end">
      Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.
      <br>
      I love you.
